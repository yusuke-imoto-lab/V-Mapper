# V-Mapper - Velocity Mapper

V-Mapper (velocity Mapper) is a topological data analysis method for high-dimensional data with position and velocity. 
It describes a topological structure and flows on it simultaneously as a weighted directed graph (V-Mapper graph) by embedding given velocity data in the edges of the Mapper graph.

## Installation
To install V-Mapper package, use `pip` as follows:

```
$ pip install vmapper
